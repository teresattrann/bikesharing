## Overview of Analysis:

In this analysis, we will use Pandas to change the "tripduration" from an integer type into a datetime datatype. We will then use the converted data in Tableau in order to create a set of visualizations.

## Summary:

Lookng at our visualizations, we can see that males, specifically male subscibers, have the highest bike sharing usage. We can also see that the peak hours for trips are from 7am-9am and 5pm-7pm. Thursdays have the highest usage, followed by Monday and Tuesdays. Therefore, bike repairs should be made during those non-peak hours. From our visualizations, the top starting and ending locations are very similar, meaning users are starting and ending near the same locations every time they are using the citibikes.

Two additional visualizations we can look at are Top Starting and Ending Locations by Gender: 

Top Starting Locations by Gender - Males seem to dominate bike riding  near the middle and lower half of New York while females in the top half of New York.

Top Ending Locations by Gender - Males have a consistent starting and ending location. While most females are also consistent in starting and ending locations, some females and unknown have scattered towards the bottom of New York for their ending location.
